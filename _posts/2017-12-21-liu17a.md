title: SUNNY with Algorithm Configuration
abstract: The SUNNY algorithm is a portfolio technique originally tailored for Constraint
  Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). SUNNY allows to select a set of solvers to be run
  on a given CSP, and was proven to be effective in the MiniZinc Challenge, i.e.,
  the yearly international competition for CP solvers. In 2015, SUNNY was compared
  with other solver selectors in the first ICON Challenge on algorithm selection with
  less satisfactory performance. In this paper we briefly describe the new version
  of the SUNNY approach for algorithm selection, that was submitted to the first Open
  Algorithm Selection Challenge.
