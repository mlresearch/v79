title: 'ASAP.V2 and ASAP.V3: Sequential optimization of an Algorithm Selector and
  a Scheduler'
abstract: Algorithm portfolios are known to offer robust performances, efficiently
  overcoming the weakness of every single algorithm on some particular problem instances.
  The presented asap system relies on the alternate optimization of two complementary
  portfolio approaches, namely a sequential scheduler and a per-instance algorithm
  selector.
