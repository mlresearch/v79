title: 'OASC-2017: *Zilla Submission'
abstract: "*Zilla is a model-based approach for algorithm selection and the most recent
  iteration of the well-known SATzilla project. The new *Zilla system has increased
  flexibility for the user and is configurable to run with many machine learning models
  and alternatives for various pre/post processing steps (e.g., presolver selection,
  feature completion prediction, and solver subset selection). The main additions
  to our *Zilla pipeline are automated procedures for feature group selection, hyper-parameter
  tuning, and solver subsampling prior to model building. We submit two versions for
  the competition that are equivalent except for the choice of per-instance machine
  learning model. For our first submission, we use a weighted pairwise random forest
  classifier. For our second submission, we test an experimental approach that offline,
  builds a weighted pairwise random forest classifier and online, finds the nearest
  instances based on the average path lengths across trees and optimizes a schedule
  over those instances."
