title: 'AS-ASL: Algorithm Selection with Auto-sklearn'
abstract: In this paper, we describe our algorithm selection with Auto-sklearn (as-asl)
  software as it was entered in the 2017 Open Algorithm Selection Challenge. as-asl
  first selects informative sets of features and then uses those to predict distributions
  of algorithm runtimes. A classifier uses those predictions, as well as the informative
  features, to select an algorithm for each problem instance. Our source code is publicly
  available with the permissive MIT license.
